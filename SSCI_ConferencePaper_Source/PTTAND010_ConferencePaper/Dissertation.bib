abstract = {Although automation has advanced in manufacturing, the growth of automation in construction has been slow. Conventional methods of manufacturing automation do not lend themselves to construction of large structures with internal features. This may explain the slow rate of growth in construction automation. Contour Crafting (CC) is a recent layered fabrication technology that has a great potential in automated construction of whole structures as well as sub-components. Using this process, a single house or a colony of houses, each with possibly a different design, may be automatically constructed in a single run, imbedded in each house all the conduits for electrical, plumbing and air-conditioning. Our research also addresses the application of CC in building habitats on other planets. CC will most probably be one of the very few feasible approaches for building structures on other planets, such as Moon and Mars, which are being targeted for human colonization before the end of the new century.},

@misc{Verbancsics2010,
abstract = {An important goal formachine learning is to transfer knowledge between tasks. For example, learn- ing to play RoboCup Keepaway should contribute to learning the full game of RoboCup soccer. Previous approaches to transfer in Keepaway have focused on transforming the original represen- tation to fit the new task. In contrast, this paper explores the idea that transfer is most effective if the representation is designed to be the same even across different tasks. To demonstrate this point, a birds eye view (BEV) representation is introduced that can represent different tasks on the same two-dimensionalmap. For example, both the 3 vs. 2 and 4 vs. 3 Keepaway tasks can be represented on the same BEV. Yet the problem is that a raw two-dimensional map is high-dimensional and un- structured. This paper shows how this problem is addressed naturally by an idea from evolutionary computation called indirect encoding, which compresses the representation by exploiting its geom- etry. The result is that the BEV learns a Keepaway policy that transfers without further learning or manipulation. It also facilitates transferring knowledge learned in a different domain, Knight Joust, into Keepaway. Finally, the indirect encoding of the BEV means that its geometry can be changed without altering the solution. Thus static representations facilitate several kinds of transfer.},

abstract = {Social insects-ants, bees, termites, and wasps-can be viewed as powerful problem-solving systems with sophisticated collective intelligence. Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve-finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges-have important counterparts in engineering and computer science. This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.},

Collective Neuro-Evolution (CONE) co-evolves multiple robot controllers using emergent behavioral specialization in order to increase collective behavior task performance. CONE is comparatively evaluated with two related controller design methods in a collective construction task. The task requires robots to gather building blocks and assemble the blocks in specific sequences in order to build structures. Results indicate that for the team sizes tested, CONE yields a higher collective behavior task performance (comparative to related methods) as a consequence of its capability to evolve specialized behaviors. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A major challenge for evolutionary computation is to evolve phenotypes such as neural networks, sensory systems, or motor controllers at the same level of complexity as found in biological organisms. In order to meet this challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is, evolutionary mechanisms where the same genes are used multiple times in the process of building a phenotype. Such gene reuse allows compact representations of very complex phenotypes. Development is a natural choice for implementing indirect encodings, if only because nature itself uses this very process. Motivated by the development of embryos in nature, we define artificial embryogeny (AE) as the subdiscipline of evolutionary computation (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase. An increasing number of AE systems are currently being developed, and a need has arisen for a principled approach to comparing and contrasting, and ultimately building, such systems. Thus, in this paper, we develop a principled taxonomy for AE. This taxonomy provides a unified context for long-term research in AE, so that implementation decisions can be compared and contrasted along known dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems. It also allows predicting how the settings of various AE parameters affect the capacity to efficiently evolve complex phenotypes.},

In this paper, I describe a system of simple, identical, autonomous robots able to build two-dimensional structures of arbitrary design by rearranging blocks of building material into desired shapes. Structure design is specified com- pactly as a high-level geometric program; robots translate this program into physical form via their fixed behavioral programming. Robots are interchangeable both within and between construction projects, and need not be individually reprogrammed between dissimilar projects. Such a construction team could be used as the first stage in a system for remote building of structures, laying out the floor plan that a more sophisticated system could extend upwards. 1},

Our aim is to determine how the co-evolutive method can obtain better results from the point of view of running time and classification ability.

abstract = {Specialization is observable in many complex adaptive systems and is thought by many to be a fundamental mechanism for achieving optimal efficiency within organizations operating within complex adaptive systems. This chapter presents a survey and critique of collective behavior systems designed using biologically inspired principles, where specialization that emerges as a result of system dynamics and is used problem solver or means to increase task performance. The chapter presents an argument for developing design methodologies and principles that facilitate emergent specialization in collective behavior systems. Open problems of current research and future research directions are highlighted for the purpose of encouraging the development of such emergent specialization design methodologies.},

abstract = {Though based on abstractions of nature, current evolutionary algorithms and artificial life models lack the drive to complexity characteristic of natural evolution. Thus this paper argues that the prevalent fitness-pressure-based abstraction does not capture how natural evolution discovers complexity. Alternatively, this paper proposes that natural evolution can be abstracted as a process that discovers many ways to express the same functionality. That is, all successful organisms must meet the same minimal criteria of survival and reproduction. This abstraction leads to the key idea in this paper: Searching for novel ways of meeting the same minimal criteria, which is an accelerated model of this new abstraction, may be an effective search algorithm. Thus the existing novelty search method, which rewards any new behavior, is extended to enforce minimal criteria. Such minimal criteria novelty search prunes the space of viable behaviors and may often be more efficient than the search for novelty alone. In fact, when compared to the raw search for novelty and traditional fitness-based search in the two maze navigation experiments in this paper, minimal criteria novelty search evolves solutions more consistently. It is possible that refining the evolutionary computation abstraction in this way may lead to solving more ambitious problems and evolving more complex artificial organisms.},

abstract = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

@article{Nolfi1996,
abstract = {To study learning as an adaptive process, one must take into consideration the role of evolution, which is the primary adaptive process. In addition, learning should be studied in (artificial) organisms that live in an independent physical environment in such a way that the input from the environment can be at least partially controlled by the organisms' behavior. To explore these issues, we used a genetic algorithm to simulate the evolution of a population of neural networks, each controlling the behavior of a small mobile robot that must explore efficiently an environment surrounded by walls. Because the environment changes from one generation to the next, each network must learn during its life to adapt to the particular environment into which it happens to be born. We found that evolved networks incorporate a genetically inherited predisposition to learn that can be described as (1) the presence of initial conditions that tend to canalize learning in the right directions; (2) the tendency to behave in a way that enhances the perceived differences between different environments and determines input stimuli that facilitate the learning of adaptive changes; and (3) the ability to reach desirable stable states.},
